  This is an INS driver for the combination L3G4200D gyro and ADXL345 accelerometer.
  This combination is available as a cheap 10DOF sensor on ebay

  This sensor driver is an example only - it should not be used in any
  serious autopilot as the latencies on I2C prevent good timing at
  high sample rates. It is useful when doing an initial port of
  ardupilot to a board where only I2C is available, and a cheap sensor
  can be used.
