# Phenix Devkit Firmware v0.1
The PhenixPro DevKit is a intelligent flight control, computing and networking platform. It's integrated in a Xilinx Zynq SoC, with dual core ARM Cortex-A9 CPU and FPGA fabric on a signal chip. It is also running PhenOS(based on freeRTOS) and Linux on each CPU core respectively. Attitude estimation, flight control, navigation are implemented by ArduPilot(http://ardupilot.org). So far, it only support quadcopter.

Here is a simple process for developers to compile the source code.

compile cpu1 BSP(Board Support Package):

```
make bsp-clean;make bsp -j8
```

compile pilot code:

```
make pilot-clean;make pilot -j8
```

compile all:

```
make clean;make -j8
```

**Note:**

â€‹	Bcause the pilot code depends on cpu1 bsp, please make sure that you have compiled bsp before compiling pilot code.
