# Phenix Devkit Firmware v0.1

This version is not a perfect one, baudrate of the uart can't be configured because its uartlite IP core in FPGA is licensed without programmability, and the filesystem and data logging function with original ardupilot are not supported so far in the DevKit, but will be coming soon.

Here is a simple process for developers to compile the source code.

compile cpu1 BSP(Board Support Package):

```
make bsp-clean;make bsp -j8
```

compile pilot code:

```
make pilot-clean;make pilot -j8
```

compile all:

```
make clean;make -j8
```

**Note:**

â€‹	Bcause the pilot code depends on cpu1 bsp, please make sure that you have compiled bsp before compiling pilot code.
